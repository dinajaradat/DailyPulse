Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

To resolve conflict : we first will try to understand each other perspactive and if the conflict continue we will vote on some solution.
each person will do the task related to him, if any one do more than his work will not take it.
To garantee each member understand the project and his task we will explain each idea in scheduled meetings.
I will ask him to keepup with his tasks.
if he didn't keepup and submit his work twice the third we will inform the instructor that he is not doing his part of job.
Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

everyday from 10:00 am to 11:59 pm
we will use slack and discord to comunicate.
we will take 1 hour break every 5 hours work
have more meetings each day to each member have more than one or two task daily to increase the productivity.
in the weekend we will comunicate on slack
letting each member to explain his point of view for team then voting.
to not underestimate any member ideas and thoughts and give the propare time to explain his idea.

Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

we will assign the tasks for each member daily and ensuring that each member doing his part.
